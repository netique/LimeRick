Description: Enables close connection between R and LimeSurvey - one of the most
    advanced open-source scripts for Computer-Aided Web Interviewing.
    Using new RemoteControl2 API for two-way data exchange allows for
    importing on-line survey responses into R,
    adding new responses to the survey directly from R,
    automatically accessing surveys and question properties,
    implementing passive measurement surveys,
    developing data products based on real-time declarative data collection, and more.
